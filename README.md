**Project: Write a Data Science Blog Post**

**Installation**
* Python version 3.11.3

Libraries used are as follows;
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Sklearn

**Project Motivation**
The project involved analyzing Airbnb data from the Seattle area to pick insights that will inform business action. Generating a blog post at the end was quite intriguing as it helped solidify storytelling skills.

**File Descriptions**
The project uses the Seatle Airbnb dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/airbnb/seattle , which contains the following files;

* Listings, including full descriptions and average review score CSV file.
* Reviews, including a unique ID for each reviewer and detailed comments CSV file.
* Calendar, including listing id and the price and availability for that day CSV file.

**Summary of The Results**
The CRISP - DM process was used with the Seattle Airbnb data and it involved the following steps
1. Understanding the business objectives which were in the form of 4 business questions.
2. Reviewing the three Seattle Airbnb csv datasets from Kaggle.
3. Exploring the calendar.csv, listings.csv and reviews.csv datasets and doing data cleaning to address null values, duplicate values etc. 
4. Data analysis and visualization to answer the 4 business questions.
5. Confirming that the analysis answered the 4 business questions.

The 4 business questions were answered as follows;

* What are the room type preferences in the Seattle Airbnb market? - Entire homes are most preferred, followed by Private rooms and finally shared rooms.
* What are the property types hosts have offered for the Seattle Airbnb market? - The top 5 preferred properties are Houses, Apartments, Townhouses, Condominiums and Lofts in that order.
* What are the price distributions for the different room types offered for the Seattle Airbnb market? - Entire homes cost roughly between $100 and $175 per night, private rooms cost roughly between $60 and $80 per night and private rooms cost roughly between $40 and $60 per night.
* Which neighborhoods in the Seattle area have the most property listed? - Capitol Hill, Downtown, Central Area, Queen Anne and Ballard have the most property listed in that order.
